# I want to be able to populate new articles, not edit them
# but I do want people to be able to leave notes on articles and have the ability to edit those notes in the future.

# I want there to be a page that has all of the news articles a user has archived
## when you go to the archive page, I want to find categories of news
### click a category and archived news articles show up in the next page
### click a particular article and notes show up on the next page underneath that article's category, date, and title


# The user should be able to signup, login, or logout from the homepage
## Login or Logout from any other page

### Questions

# When I create a migrations, do I need to wait until they're all created to run db:migrate?

# do articles need to have a notes attribute or is that separate?
# Do users need a user_id attribute and do categories need a category_id attribute? Or is this done automatically when I create a table in the database?

## I want the user to be able to pick from categories once they've logged in
### i.e. home page "Log in to get started!"
### then categories populate
### click a category and you are redirected to a page with articles inside that category
### click an article and comments will display relevant to that article (this is where the user has the ability to edit and save comments)
### DO I WANT THE WHOLE ARTICLE TO APPEAR OR JUST THE COMMENTS ON THE ARTICLE WITH A RELEVANT LINK?
